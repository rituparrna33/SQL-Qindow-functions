#This lesson uses data from Washington DC's Capital Bikeshare Program, which publishes detailed trip-level historical data on their website. 
The data was downloaded in February, 2014, but is limited to data collected during the
first quarter of 2012. Each row represents one ride. Most fields are self-explanatory, except rider_type: 
"Registered" indicates a monthly membership to the rideshare program, "Casual" incidates that the rider bought a 3-day pass. 
The start_time and end_time fields were cleaned up from their original forms to suit SQL date formattingâ€”they are stored in this table as timestamps.



####Write a query modification of the above example query that shows the duration of each ride 
###as a percentage of the total time accrued by riders from each start_terminal


SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS start_terminal_sum,
       (duration_seconds/SUM(duration_seconds) OVER (PARTITION BY start_terminal))*100 AS pct_of_total_time
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
 ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC
 
 
 Write a query that shows a running total of the duration of bike rides (similar to the last example), but grouped by end_terminal, 
 and with ride duration sorted in descending order.
 
 SELECT end_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY end_terminal ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC)
         AS running_total
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
